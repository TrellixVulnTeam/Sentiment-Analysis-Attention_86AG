    "Based on Tutorials 6 and 7, we'll implement and train an improved sentiment analysis model.\n",
    "We'll use self-attention instead of RNNs and incorporate pre-trained word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tutorial 6 we saw that we can train word embeddings together with the model.\n",
    "Although this produces embeddings which are customized to the specific task at hand,\n",
    "it also greatly increases training time.\n",
    "A common technique is to use pre-trained word embeddings.\n",
    "This is essentially a large mapping from words (e.g. in english) to some\n",
    "high-dimensional vector, such that semantically similar words have an embedding that is\n",
    "\"close\" by some metric (e.g. cosine distance).\n",
    "Use the [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) 6B embeddings for this purpose.\n",
    "You can load these vectors into the weights of an `nn.Embedding` layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tutorial 7 we learned how attention can be used to learn to predict a relative importance\n",
    "for each element in a sequence, compared to the other elements.\n",
    "Here, we'll replace the RNN with self-attention only approach similar to Transformer models, roughly based on [this paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-6219.pdf).\n",
    "After embedding each word in the sentence using the pre-trained word-embedding a positional-encoding vector is added to provide each word in the sentence a unique value based on it's location.\n",
    "One or more self-attention layers are then applied to the results, to obtain an importance weighting for each word.\n",
    "Then we classify the sentence based on the average these weighted encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, using these approaches, you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement a **baseline** model: Use pre-trained embeddings with an RNN-based model.\n",
    "You can use LSTM/GRU or bi-directional versions of these, in a way very similar to what we implemented in the tutorial.\n",
    "-  Implement an **improved** model: Based on the self-attention approach, implement an attention-based sentiment analysis model that has 1-2 self-attention layers instead of an RNN. You should use the same pre-trained word embeddings for this model.\n",
    "- You can use pytorch's built-in RNNs, attention layers, etc.\n",
    "- For positional encoding you can use the sinosoidal approach described in the paper (first proposed [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)). You can use existing online implementations (even though it's straightforward to implement). \n",
    "- You can use the SST database as shown in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your results should include:\n",
    "- Everything written in the **Guidelines** above.\n",
    "- A comparative analysis: compare the baseline to the improved model. Compare in terms of overall classification accuracy and show a multiclass confusion matrix.\n",
    "- Visualize of the attention maps for a few movie reviews from each class, and explain the results."

    "In HW3 we implemented a simple GANs from scratch, using an approach very similar to the original GAN paper. However, the results left much to be desired and we discovered first-hand how hard it is to train GANs due to their inherent instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the prevailing approaches for improving training stability for GANs is to use a technique called [Spectral Normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05957.pdf) to normalize the largest singular value of a weight matrix so that it equals 1.\n",
    "This approach is generally applied to the discriminator's weights in order to stabilize training. The resulting model is sometimes referred to as a SN-GAN.\n",
    "See Appendix A in the linked paper for the exact algorithm. You can also use pytorch's `spectral_norm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another very common improvement to the vanilla GAN is known a [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf) (WGAN). It uses a simple modification to the loss function, with strong theoretical justifications based on the Wasserstein (earth-mover's) distance.\n",

    "One problem with generative models for images is that it's difficult to objectively assess the quality of the resulting images.\n",

    "we'll use the [Inception Score](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03498.pdf).\n",
    "This uses a pre-trained Inception CNN model on the generated images and computes a score based on the predicted probability for each class.\n",
    "Although not a perfect proxy for subjective quality, it's commonly used a way to compare generative models.\n",
    "You can use an implementation of this score that you find online, e.g. [this one](https://github.com/sbarratt/inception-score-pytorch) or implement it yourself.\n",

    "As a dataset, you can use [LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) as in HW3 or [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html), or even choose a custom dataset (note that there's a dataloder for CelebA in `torchvision`). \n",
