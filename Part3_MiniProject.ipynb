    "Based on Tutorials 6 and 7, we'll implement and train an improved sentiment analysis model.\n",
    "We'll use self-attention instead of RNNs and incorporate pre-trained word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tutorial 6 we saw that we can train word embeddings together with the model.\n",
    "Although this produces embeddings which are customized to the specific task at hand,\n",
    "it also greatly increases training time.\n",
    "A common technique is to use pre-trained word embeddings.\n",
    "This is essentially a large mapping from words (e.g. in english) to some\n",
    "high-dimensional vector, such that semantically similar words have an embedding that is\n",
    "\"close\" by some metric (e.g. cosine distance).\n",
    "Use the [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) 6B embeddings for this purpose.\n",
    "You can load these vectors into the weights of an `nn.Embedding` layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tutorial 7 we learned how attention can be used to learn to predict a relative importance\n",
    "for each element in a sequence, compared to the other elements.\n",
    "Here, we'll replace the RNN with self-attention only approach similar to Transformer models, roughly based on [this paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-6219.pdf).\n",
    "After embedding each word in the sentence using the pre-trained word-embedding a positional-encoding vector is added to provide each word in the sentence a unique value based on it's location.\n",
    "One or more self-attention layers are then applied to the results, to obtain an importance weighting for each word.\n",
    "Then we classify the sentence based on the average these weighted encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, using these approaches, you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement a **baseline** model: Use pre-trained embeddings with an RNN-based model.\n",
    "You can use LSTM/GRU or bi-directional versions of these, in a way very similar to what we implemented in the tutorial.\n",
    "-  Implement an **improved** model: Based on the self-attention approach, implement an attention-based sentiment analysis model that has 1-2 self-attention layers instead of an RNN. You should use the same pre-trained word embeddings for this model.\n",
    "- You can use pytorch's built-in RNNs, attention layers, etc.\n",
    "- For positional encoding you can use the sinosoidal approach described in the paper (first proposed [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf)). You can use existing online implementations (even though it's straightforward to implement). \n",
    "- You can use the SST database as shown in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your results should include:\n",
    "- Everything written in the **Guidelines** above.\n",
    "- A comparative analysis: compare the baseline to the improved model. Compare in terms of overall classification accuracy and show a multiclass confusion matrix.\n",
